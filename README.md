#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering is critical in the tech industry as it enables the creation of software systems that improve lives in all disciplines. For example in the healthcare system software solutions for the Radiology area such as Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), can improve patient outcomes by enabling patients far away from a radiologist to get access to radiology consultation services by using the PACS 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Creation of high-level programming languages - One of the biggest milestones was the creation of high-level programming languages such as Fortran around the 1950s and 1960s. Before that people used machine language that was written using binary code (0s and 1s) that can be executed by machines directly. The introduction of high-level programming languages allowed engineers to write code using human-readable syntax. This innovation abstracted the complexity of machine-level coding, making software development more accessible and efficient
2. Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) - Early programming languages faced some challenges in how the code was written and readability and to solve this complexity pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra promoted the use of control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines to create more readable, maintainable, and bug-free code. This milestone laid the foundation for modern programming languages and best practices in software development.
3. Rise of agile methodologies around the 2000s - Agile methodologies enhanced software development by promoting iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - This involves gathering all the information required about the software solution to be addressed.
2. Design - after gathering all the information, design for the solution is done such as algorithms, system modeling, and flowcharts are created as well as the Ui and UX of the system. A prototype can be produced in the design phase
3. Development - after designing the solution software developers can start writing the code and building the design based on the specifications
4. Testing - after development testing is conducted to ensure the software is of high quality and as well meets the functional requirements
5. Deployment - after thorough testing and the software passes all tests, the application will be ready to be deployed and released to users.
6. Maintenance - after deployment ongoing support to the application continues and updates as well
   


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development, best suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, like building medical devices. It focuses on completing one phase before moving to the next, with thorough documentation and limited customer involvement until the end. In contrast, Agile is an iterative and flexible approach, ideal for projects where requirements may evolve, such as developing mobile apps or continuously updating an e-commerce platform. Agile emphasizes regular customer feedback, frequent releases, and the ability to adapt quickly to changes.

Explanation of the given examples:
Medical Devices and Waterfall - Medical devices require strict adherence to regulatory standards, thorough documentation, and rigorous testing to ensure safety and compliance. The Waterfall methodology is ideal for this because it provides a structured, step-by-step process with detailed documentation and reviews at each phase. This ensures that every aspect of the device is carefully planned, implemented, and validated before it goes to market, reducing the risk of errors.

E-commerce and Agile - E-commerce platforms need to be flexible and responsive to changing customer needs, market trends, and technological advancements. Agile allows for rapid iteration, frequent updates, and continuous improvement, which are crucial in a dynamic environment like e-commerce. The ability to release new features quickly, gather customer feedback, and make adjustments on the fly helps keep the platform competitive and aligned with user expectations.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes up the software application. He/she works on implementing the functionality specified in the project requirements, fixing bugs, and optimizing the code for performance. Software developers collaborate closely with designers, other developers, and stakeholders to ensure the software meets user needs.   He/she may also be involved in code reviews, debugging, and documentation of the codebase.
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensure that the software meets the required quality standards before it is released. They design and execute test plans, identify defects, and work with developers to resolve issues
Project Manager - oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within scope, and on budget. He/she coordinates the efforts of the development and Quality Assurance teams, manages resources, and communicates with stakeholders to keep everyone informed about the project's progress

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments(IDEs)
   IDEs provide a comprehensive environment that brings together various tools and features needed for software development. These tools include syntax highlighting, code       completion, and debugging tools. The use of IDEs helps developers write, test, and debug code more efficiently, reducing errors and increasing productivity. Examples of IDEs     include VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
   VCS are tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. VCS allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project by          maintaining a history of code changes, enabling developers to revert to previous versions if needed, and facilitating the branching and merging of code. Examples include     Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face many challenges and some include: 

Changing Requirements: As development progresses, project needs might change, causing delays and expanding the project’s scope. To address this, software engineers should keep open lines of communication among team members and use Agile methodologies to adapt to changes effectively.
Tight Deadlines: Rushed development to meet tight deadlines can lead to poor quality in the final product. Software engineers should manage this by prioritizing tasks and focusing on the most important parts of the project first.
Technical Debt: Using quick fixes or less-than-ideal solutions can create problems later, making future development harder and more costly. Software engineers should regularly reassess project goals and timelines to maintain quality and address technical debt effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing
   Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system. The purpose is to verify that each unit   performs as expected. Unit tests are important because they help catch bugs early in development, ensure that code changes do not introduce new errors, and make the          codebase more reliable and easier to maintain.

2. Integration Testing
   Integration testing focuses on verifying that different components or modules of the application work together correctly. This type of testing checks the interactions       between integrated units to ensure that they function together as intended. It is crucial because it identifies issues that occur when units are combined, such as data       inconsistencies or communication problems between modules.

3. System Testing
   System testing tests the complete and integrated software application as a whole. This type of testing verifies that the entire system meets the specified requirements       and performs correctly in a real-world environment. It is important to ensure that the software behaves as expected when all components are working together and that         it meets the overall functional and non-functional requirements.

4. Acceptance Testing
   Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release. This type of testing is typically conducted by end-users or      stakeholders to validate that the software solves the intended problems and meets their needs. It is crucial to ensure that the software is user-friendly, functional,        and meets the expectations of those who will ultimately use it.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It involves designing inputs in a way that guides the AI to produce accurate, relevant, and useful answers.

Importance of Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is crucial because it helps ensure that the AI provides accurate and relevant responses, making interactions more efficient and effective. By designing clear and specific prompts, you can save time, improve user satisfaction, and make better use of the AI's capabilities. It also helps in reducing errors and biases in the AI's output, leading to more reliable and useful results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
“Tell me about the book.”

Improved Prompt:

“Can you summarize the book ‘To Become a Software Developer’ by Ronnie Kakunguwo, highlighting its key themes and main points?”
Explanation:

The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the book title and author, ensuring the AI provides information about the correct work. It asks for a summary, which directs the AI to condense the content and focuses on “key themes and main points,” guiding the AI to highlight the most important aspects. This precision and clarity help the AI deliver a relevant and accurate response, tailored to the user's request.
